    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conversation AI team, a research initiative founded by Jigsaw and Google builds a technology to prevent voices in Conversation. In 2020, Jigsaw organized a competition on Kaggle where the competitors has to build machine learning models that can identify toxicity in Online conversations, where toxicity is defined as `anything rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely` to make someone leave the discussion. If these contributions can be identified, we could have a safer, more collaborative internet.     \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the competition, competitors were provided several files, specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "`jigsaw-toxic-comment-train.csv` - data from the [Jigsaw toxic comment classification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). The dataset is made up of English comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "`jigsaw-unintended-bias-train.csv` - data from the [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification). This is an expanded version of the Civil Comments dataset with a range of additional labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`test.csv` - comments from Wikipedia talk pages in different non-English languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "`validation.csv` - comments from Wikipedia talk pages in different non-English languages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Metric\n",
    "Submissions were evaluated based on Area Under the ROC Curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategies to Tackle\n",
    "### `Monolingual Approach`\n",
    "Monolingual models are the type of language models which are trained on a single language.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are focused on understanding and generating text in a specific language. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a monolingual model trained on English language will be proficient in understanding and generating English text. \n",
    "\n",
    "These models are typically for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis and more within a specific language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monolingual models can be beneficial to utilize when we have a specific language in our training, testing datasets and in the upcoming unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `Multilingual Approach`\n",
    "Multilingual models are, on the other hand, are trained on multiple different languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are designed to handle and process text in multiple languages, allowing them to perform across different languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multilingual models have the advantage of of being able to provide language-agnostic solutions, as they can handle a wide-range of languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "They can be used for zero-shot and few-shot learning, where the model can perform a task in a language it has not been seen specifically trained on by leveraging its knowledge of other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Which models to use for our problem?`\n",
    "As per the dataset given in the competition, we have only english data in our training dataset and very samples are given in the validation dataset containing languages `Spanish`, `Turkish` and `Italian` only and the Testing dataset contains languages `Turkish`, `Spanish`, `Italian`, `Russian`, `French` and `Portugese`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since in our validation and test dataset contains non-english languages it would be better approach to build multilingual models rather than monolingual models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we had only one language (as stated above) building monolingual models would be a better choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss Multilingual models approach a bit more:\n",
    "\n",
    "How are multilingual models are trained?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilingual models are pre-trained on a mix of different languages and they don't distinguish between the languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "The English BERT was pre-trained on English Wikipedia and BookCorpus dataset, while multilingual models like mBERT was pre-trained on 102 different languages from largest Wikipedia dataset and XLM-Roberta was pre-trained on CommonCrawl dataset from 100 different languages respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Cross Lingual Transfer`\n",
    "Cross-lingual transfer refers to transfer learning using data and models available for one language for which ample such resources are available (e.g., English) to solve tasks in another, commonly more low-resource, language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we are trying to create an application that can automatically detect whether a sentence or phrase is toxic or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Models like XLM-Roberta provides us the ability to fine tune it on English dataset and predict to identify comments in any different language.\n",
    "\n",
    "XLM-R is able to take it's specific knowledge learnt in one language and apply it to a different langauge (languages), even though it never seen the language during fine-tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is of transfer learning applied from one language to another language is referred to as `Cross-Lingual Transfer (AKA Zero-Shot Learning)` .\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason to use Pre-Trained multi-lingual models for a task like this (as in our case) is that is the `Lack of languages by resources` i.e., different languages have different amounts of training data available to build models like BERT and its variants. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages like English, Chinese, Russian, Indonesian, Vietnamese etc. are the languages that have high resource languages, whereas languages like sundanese, assamese etc. are low resource languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Training our own BERT like model on these low resources could be very expensive in terms of data collection and performance-wise  , therefore, We should leverage these multi-lingual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `What experiments did I perform ?`\n",
    "At the Overall level, I performed 9 experiments with the following ideas keeping in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform Pre-processing techniques like removal of stopwords, removing URLs, Contraction to Expansion of words, removing multiple characters from words and removal of punctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "From model stand point we experimented with 2 models mBERT & XLM-Roberta.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Training dataset perspective we used 2 types of datasets: one case where we used the provided training datasets where we tried to balance the dataset by the target and the other case where we used the translated training dataset of languages provided in the test dataset along with the english language with class balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We always trained on validation dataset as well to further boost the performance of the model."

Open up the cloned directory using VS code (I'm using VS code), and use the terminal (git bash in my case) and after installing the git lfs, use the command `git lfs install` to start tracking the file that we want to track.

    "    - `venv/`\n",

    "    - `git add .`\n",
    "    - `git commit -m \"commit message that you want\"`\n",
    "14. Push(load) the files to Hugging Face\n",
